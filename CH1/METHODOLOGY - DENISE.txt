Silence is the greatest form of contempt 


METHODOLOGY

Consider the costs  -  
	Moricoco feed - per kilo, 10 pesos 4 kilos per kilo 
	Standard feed - 

Create 6 batches of feed 

//  0% Coconut 100% Moringa
 20% Coconut  80% Moringa
 40% Coconut  60% Moringa
 60% Coconut  40% Moringa
 80% Coconut  20% Moringa
// 100% Coconut   0% Moringa

2 batches of wet and dry 200 grams each 

Get 3 types of standard feed 
Test for the nutrient content of each 

Compare the data with t-test and ANOVA


Recommendations

the experimental feed and standard feed  


RESEARCH QUESTIONS

General Questions
	
	In general, the researcher aims to answer the question:
	Is it better for farmers to use coconut pulp and malunggay pellets instead of traditional poultry feed?

Specific Questions

	1. What are the specific nutritional content of Moricoco pellets.
	2. What are the difference of costs between Moricoco pellets and standard chicken feed?
	3. Is there a significant difference on the nutritional content of Moricoco pellets compared to commercial poultry feed?


HYPOTHESIS

N_0 : There is no significant difference between Moricoco pellets and commercial poultry feed.

N_A : There is a significant difference between Moricoco pellets and commercial poultry feed.


RESEARCH OBJECTIVES 
	
	The research aims to determine whether Moricoco pellets made from coconut pulp and malunggay can be an effective alternative for commercial poultry feed. Specifically, it aims to study the effectivity of Moricoco in terms of price, accessibility and ease of manufacture, and nutritional content in comparison with standard brands of commercial poultry feed.

RESEARCH METHODS 

Procure materials:
	Malunggay Leaves
	Coconut pulp
	Cornstarch for aggregate
	Two standard poultry feed 
	Manual Pellet machine
	Containers

Create feed:
	Mix the malunggay and coconut pulp in this ratio: 20/80, 40/60/ 60/40, 80/20
	Add 60 grams of cornstarch as a pellet aggregate
	Create the pellets using the machine

Test nutrition of feed and standard poultry 
	Go to Ateneo De Manila to test with nutrition content for both moricoco and standard brand

Compare it with given outcomes
	Use t-test and anova to compare and statistically answer the hypothesis
