We perform classification of data sets into specific target criterion based from feautures of other properties in a data set. The data set is the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SSDS) and contains spectroscopic data of galaxies. Each row presents a galaxy with various observed properties. We predict the Baldwin, Phillips, and Terlivich (BPT) classification using these properties. The properties are \texttt{ra} and \texttt{dec}, the right ascension and declination of the galaxy, \texttt{mjd}, \texttt{plate}, \texttt{fiberID}, which are spectroscopic observation metadata, \texttt{z} and \texttt{zErr}, the redshift and its error, \texttt{velDisp} and \texttt{velDispErr}, the velocity dispersion and its error, \texttt{psfMaf_r}, \texttt{modelMag_u}, \texttt{modelMag_g},\texttt{modelMag_r}, which are apparent magnitudes in different bands, \texttt{extiction_r}, the galactic extinction correction in the $r$-band. We also have \texttt{petroR50_r} and \texttt{petroR90_r}, which are radii containing 50\% and 90\% of the total Petrosian flux. For specifically clasifying \texttt{bptclass}, we have \texttt{nii_6584_flux}, \texttt{nii_6584_flux_err}, \texttt{h_alpha_flux}, \texttt{h_alpha_flux_err}, \texttt{oiii_5007_flux}, \texttt{oiii_5007_flux_err}, \texttt{h_beta_flux}, and \texttt{h_beta_flux_err}, which correspond to the emission line fluxes and their associated errors for [NII] 6584 Å, H-alpha, [OIII] 5007 Å, and H-beta. These emission lines are used to construct the Baldwin, Phillips, and Terlevich (BPT) diagram, which classifies galaxies into star-forming galaxies, active galactic nuclei (AGN), composite galaxies, or unclassified types based on the ratios of $\log([\text{NII}]/\text{H}\alpha)$ and $\log([\text{OIII}]/\text{H}\beta)$

To perform classification, we trained multiple machine learning models on these features, including Perceptron (linear classifier), Decision Tree (tree-based classifier), and Random Forest (ensemble classifier). These models were trained and evaluated using a training/testing split of the dataset. The classification results were analyzed using confusion matrices to assess model performance in predicting \texttt{bptclass}.
