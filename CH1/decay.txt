Intro talks about radioactive decay


Experimental Methodology

4 types of die - 4 side, 6 side, 8 side, 12 side
Throw each sort of die 5 times each
For each throw, remove the dies who hit the maximum number
Do again and again until it hits 0
Repeat 5 times for each dice

Objectives

Identify the analogous theoretical Half-life of the radioactive dice for each one
Create a model given the theory of radioactive dice
Compare the experimental results and use statistics to determine whether the model is correct
Get the best fit model 
Identify an experimental half life and explain it away why so and so


suppose one throw equals t=1, and every throw thereafter is t+1.
