The experimental data initially consisted of angular dispersion measurements, which were subsequently converted into corresponding wavelengths using Equation \ref{}. These wavelength values were then used to construct spectral representations of the observed elements. Figure \ref{} presents a comparative analysis of the spectra for Hydrogen and Helium, incorporating results obtained using diffraction grating spectrometry (DGS) with spatial frequencies of 100 lines/mm and 300 lines/mm, alongside data acquired from an electronic spectroscope (ES) and reference wavelengths sourced from the NIST database. Given the extensive volume of collected data, additional spectrographic images and intensity distribution graphs are provided in the appendices for further reference.

Figure \ref{} presents the emission spectrum of Hydrogen, demonstrating a strong correspondence between the observed and theoretical emission lines. These lines correspond to the Balmer series \cite{}, which represents the visible energy transitions of Hydrogen. However, both spectroscopic methods failed to detect the 434 nm emission line, as evident in the figure. Table \ref{} provides the equivalent energy values corresponding to the experimentally obtained wavelengths (excluding the 434 nm transition) across the three diffraction gratings, alongside the theoretical energy gap transitions for comparison. The experimental results exhibit a maximum error of 12% from the expected values, with errors as low as 0%. Given the inconsistencies and missing spectral features in the data obtained from the electronic spectroscope, its results have been omitted from the table. These findings indicate that the employed instrumentation maintains a reasonable degree of accuracy within its operational constraints.

A comparative analysis of the Helium emission spectrum (Figure \ref{}) reveals that the spectroscopic measurements successfully captured the four major emission lines listed in the reference database. However, the data acquired from the ES exhibits a high noise-to-signal ratio, significantly reducing its reliability. While the emission lines can be discerned with careful inspection, the overall dataset is not of sufficient quality for quantitative analysis. As such, the analysis only uses results from DGS. The corresponding energy gap analysis is provided in Table \ref{} in the appendices, demonstrating a maximum deviation of 11% from theoretical values, consistent with the error margins observed in the Hydrogen spectrum.

For the remaining analyzed elements, the following observations were made: For Nitrogen, significant spectral dispersion was observed,making the precise determination of emission lines using the DGS rather difficult. A similar issue was encountered with the electronic spectroscope (ES), rendering an effective energy gap analysis infeasible. Reference data indicates that Nitrogen exhibits an extensive and highly diffuse spectral profile, making precise line identification challenging. However, the primary emission lines remain distinguishable in both DGS and ES spectra.

For Neon, the emission lines were well-defined, allowing for a reliable spectral analysis (refer to Table \ref{}). Given the relatively high number of Neonâ€™s spectral lines, only those detected in the experiment were compared against the major reference values. The observed deviations were minimal, with a maximum error of 0.52%.

For Carbon Dioxide, reference databases indicate the absence of visible \ch{CO2} emission lines, as its primary emission transitions occur in the infrared region, specifically at \qty{4.26}{\micro\meter} and \qty{15}{\micro\meter}. Any visible emissions are inherently weak. Consequently, despite the detection of faint emissions by both DGS and ES, no meaningful spectral analysis could be performed.

For Argon, the emission spectra obtained from both DGS and ES demonstrated a complete divergence from the reference emission lines. However, the consistency between the two experimental methods show a systematic discrepancy, making any further analysis innefective.

Finally, for Mercury, prominent emission lines were detected, exhibiting strong agreement across DGS, ES, and reference spectra, with the exception of the 398 nm line, which was shifted to approximately 430 nm in both experimental setups. Despite this deviation, an energy gap analysis was conducted (Table \ref{}), yielding a maximum error of 7%.
