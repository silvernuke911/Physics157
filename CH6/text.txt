We use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to determine how to reduce an unraveled 2D array of pixel values of image (10304 dimensional space) to a single or smaller dimensions such that it can be more easily analyzed. There are 400 samples used from a database of faces as a database for the analysis, resulting into 400 principal components (PC). It should be 10304 but the process has reduced it into 400.

Figure 1 (top-left) shows the cumulative sum of PCs which shows how much PC influences the variance in the data set. It shows that 80% of the variance in the data can be explained by 50 PCs. Figure 2 (top-right) shows a scatter plot correlating PC0 with PC1, which shows a clustering of points in certain areas, indicating that some features are common in different images. This implies that some images refer to the same individuals

The rest of the images (upper row), shows the image representation of PC0, PC1, and PC2, showing common eigenfaces that explain sample variance. The lower row shows the reconstruction of a specific image from weight values, from only 1 PC, to 100 PCs, to 300 PCs. The improvement of clarity with higher use of PCs becomes apparent, with the image at 300 PCs almost indistinguishable from the original.
